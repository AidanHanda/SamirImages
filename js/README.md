# Generating Random Images with Numbers

Before running this, scroll down to the bottom of `script.js`
and check out the parameter `NUM_IMAGES_TO_GENERATE`. Start with
something small!

To run this it really should be as simple as downloading these files
and double clicking on `index.html`. Happy Hacking Samir.
