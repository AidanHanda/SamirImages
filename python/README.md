# Python Image Generator

## Installation

### Python

First make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
If you want a good distribution I would check out [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
download and install for your OS.

### Application

If you're using VSCode which I think you were last time I saw your screen, you
should be able to:

1. Open the `python` folder of this application in VSCode
2. Open a terminal in VSCode
3. Write `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the code with `python gen_images.py` or with VSCode run
